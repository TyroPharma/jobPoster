##Bugs/Features

The search function is currently commented out because I am still debugging it.

##Wishlist features

*Would love to create a User database with user authentication, messaging, comments, and likes.

*Also would love to set up an AJAX call to github/jobs/api to seed my jobs database. If all these "wishes" were to be accomplished then I'd feel that this project would be close to complete.

##Shout out

*to Jen thanks for helping me out with search funk.

*to Josh from GA Sydney for the styling tutorial.

*to each of my classmates. Your positive attitudes each day and ridiculously creative minds keep me going. :)
